# Ex1 â€“ React Props Practice

This is a simple React project built as part of a learning exercise to practice **passing data between components using props**.

## ðŸ§© What It Does

The project contains:

- A **parent component** that holds a value (e.g. text)
- A **child component** that receives this value via `props` and displays it
- It demonstrates **unidirectional data flow** in React: from parent â†’ child

Example: A user types something in one component, and it is displayed in another component through prop-passing.

## ðŸ›  Technologies

- React (with Vite)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Material UI (optional styling)
- CSS modules or plain CSS

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
